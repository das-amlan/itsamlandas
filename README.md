# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built with **Next.js** and deployed using **Firebase App Hosting**. The primary goal of this project is to showcase my skills, highlight my past projects, and provide a clear way for potential clients or collaborators to contact me.

## Overview

This website offers a clean, responsive, and easy-to-navigate interface. I chose Next.js for its excellent features like server-side rendering (SSR) and efficient routing, which contribute to a fast and modern user experience. Development was streamlined using the Firebase Studio environment. The site includes sections dedicated to my "About" information, a "Portfolio" of my work, and a "Contact" form.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using the following key technologies:

*   **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications. Chosen for its performance optimizations, routing capabilities, and developer-friendly features.
*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Provides a component-based architecture for building interactive and dynamic web pages.
*   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Enhances code maintainability, readability, and helps catch errors during development.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework. Enables rapid styling and building responsive designs directly in the markup.
*   **Firebase:** A platform for developing mobile and web applications. Specifically used here for deployment via **Firebase App Hosting**, which offers fast and secure hosting for Next.js applications.
